Relational db        MongoDB
Table                Collection
Columns              Key
Rows                 Document
Cell                 Value
Keys                 NONE

How to create relations in MongoDB
(Does not exist in the DB layer so developers must handle that)
Approach 1:
Generate keys in the application layer, put them in your objects and get corresponding elements in other collections by that key. 
Con: Several round-trips

Approach 2:
Denormalization (Yes, it's a valid strategy for Mongo!)

Pro: Fetching the data becomes faster (cause the data is grouped together)
Con: Updating is slower and difficult (you have to remember to do it everywhere)


MongoDB is schema-less per default
$jsonSchema was however introduced

No constraints in MongoDB so you can do this in the same collection:
{
    name: "Anders"
}
{
    name: true
    hoby: 123
}
{
    hobby: ["coding"]
}
